## Project content

### Sokoban Solver
[Sokoban solver](https://github.com/Fastiz/artificial-intelligence-systems/tree/master/sokoban-solver) is a module that applies multiple search algorithms to solve [Sokoban puzzles](http://www.game-sokoban.com/). The executable program lets the user execute the desired algorithm allowing the variation of the heuristic function for the corresponding algorithms.
The module has its own [readme](https://github.com/Fastiz/artificial-intelligence-systems/tree/master/sokoban-solver) file for more information.
Note that some puzzles cannot be solved with some of the algorithms.

### Genetic algorithm
[Genetic algorithm](https://github.com/Fastiz/artificial-intelligence-systems/tree/master/genetic-algorithm) contains the implementation of 'Genetic Algorithm' to find an optimal combination of equipment for a given class in a fictional role playing game.
The executable program allows full customization on the way the algorithm executes. That is to say, allows to try out multiple variations of the algorithm by modifying an input file. 
The module has its own [readme](https://github.com/Fastiz/artificial-intelligence-systems/tree/master/genetic-algorithm) file that explains in depth the options that are provided.

### Perceptron
[Perceptron](https://github.com/Fastiz/artificial-intelligence-systems/tree/master/perceptron) is about the implementation of a multilayered perceptron in python.

### Unsupervised learning
[Unsupervised learning](https://github.com/Fastiz/artificial-intelligence-systems/tree/master/unsupervised-learning) is about the implementation of Kohonen Map, Oja's rule (modification of the learning function of the simple perceptron) and Hopfield model.

### Autoencoder
[Autoencoder](https://github.com/Fastiz/artificial-intelligence-systems/tree/master/autoencoder) is about the implementation of a basic autoencoder. Then it is used as a dimensionality reduction algorithm.
We then implement a version of the autoencoder to use as a denoiser. Also we explore the generation property of the autoencoder using colors.
