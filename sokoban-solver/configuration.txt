#Following line is reserved for the parameters of IDA*, IDDFS or DFS. If you are using another algorithm remove line.
#If your algorithm is IDA* or IDDFS enter max depth or leave the line with -1 if no limit. If your algorithm is DFS, then
#enter true if you want the algorithm to cache all the visited nodes to ignore them in other branches, else enter false.
